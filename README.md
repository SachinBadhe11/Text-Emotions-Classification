# Emotion Classification with Keras

This project demonstrates how to build a simple emotion classification model using Keras in Google Colab.

## Description

The model is trained on a dataset of text and emotion labels, and can be used to predict the emotion expressed in a given text.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Emotions Dataset for NLP" which can be found on Kaggle and other sources.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run this project:

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your Google Colab environment.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Upload the `train.txt` dataset to your Colab environment.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
5. Use the `predict` function to predict the emotion expressed in a given text.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 99.79% on the test set.
